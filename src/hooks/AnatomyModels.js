        info: "Robert Hooke, a 17th-century English scientist, is often credited with pioneering work in microscopy. He used a compound microscope, detailed in his 1665 book *Micrographia*. This microscope featured a bi-convex lens and adjustable focus, allowing Hooke to observe and document microscopic structures, most famously discovering the cellular structure of cork and coining the term 'cell.'"
